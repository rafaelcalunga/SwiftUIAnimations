#  Animations

I made this project to improve my knowledge in iOS development, specially SwiftUI.

This project has some examples of animations

I learned how to:

- Create implicit animations
- Customize animations in SwiftUI
- Animate bindings
- Create explicit animations
- Control the animation stack
- Animate gestures
- Show and hide views with transitions
- Build custom transitions using ViewModifier

This app was made using the course **100 Days of SwiftUI** from [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/)
