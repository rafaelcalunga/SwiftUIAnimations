#  Animations

I made this project to improve my knowledge in iOS development, specially SwiftUI.

I learned how to:

- Create implicit animations
- Customize animations in SwiftUI
- Animate bindings

This app was made using the course *100 Days of SwiftUI* from [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/)
